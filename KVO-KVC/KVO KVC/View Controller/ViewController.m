     KVC - Key Value Coding - Allows us to access values (both get and set them) using the name of the property.
     
     Requirements:
     1. setter must be of form "setPropertyName"
     2. getter must be of form "propertyName"
     
     (If you haven't manually changed the anmes of the getter and setter of a property, it will be ready to for for KVC)
     
     If thingas are not named following the naming convention correctly, your app will crash at run-time. There are no compile time checks to see if the properties exist or not. It's a super dynamic feature.

     // KVO - Key Value Observinf (Hook for logic or UI updates)
     
     KVO lets us listen to any changes to a value, then do something in resoinse to that change.
     
     This is somewhat similar to us listening (observing) to a notification using 'NotificationCenter':
     
     - If we care to know when a value changes, we need to add an observer.
     - We don't however need to "post" or trigger the notification from happening like we do with
     Notification Center. As soon as the value changes, the notification is sent out to observers automatically.
